	<h1>Welcome to the Case of the<br />
	Stolen Soteria Files</h1>
	<p>Your adventure begins in Pittsburgh, PA.  While working late at night, you hear a ruckus coming from your Product Owners locker.  As you come around the corner to inspect the noices, you see two men dart out the exit. You give chase, but the elevator door closes on Floor 33, and since there is only one elevator, you know that you will never catch them because you will have to wait for the elevator to go ALL the way to the lobby, and then come ALL the way back up, no matter how many times you spam the keypad with the floor you want.</p>
	<p>Feeling defeated, you head back to your Product Owners locker to see what might be missing, if anything.  After scrounging through all the empty Pepsi cans, you notice that your Product Owner had a false floor in his locker, and it is open, but nothing is inside.  Could it be that this is where he stored the secret requirement documents for Project Soteria?</p>
	<p>You quickly realize that you have a choice to make. You can either go after the fools who stole the project plans for Soteria, or has your Product Owner been lying to you and there is no requirements documents, and this has all been a dream?</p>
	<p>What do you decide to do?</p>
