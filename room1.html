<p>Wise choice! Your Product Owner is out of Pepsi, and would have been very angry had you not decided to chase after the theives.</p>
<p>This has got to be the work of the Greek gods and their minions. They do not want word of Soteria getting out around the world. So, you jump in your plane and start your adventure headed for the only place you can think of, Mt Olympus.</p>
<p>As you approach Greece in your plane, the skies darken, and lightning starts flashing from the sky. It could only be Zeus, the god of lightning and king of the gods, attempting to stop you. You desperately try to avoid the lightning streaks, but atlas, there are just too many of them, and the plane is struck. Luckily, you make a crash landing in a small port town in Greece, but your plane does not survive.</p>
<p>You must quickly gather supplies you will need to retrieve the Project Soteria plans, and escape from the wrath of the Greek gods before it is too late. You are now stranded on the Isle of Greece, so if you do find the documents, you will need another way to escape, but what could you use? What would get you back to Pittsburgh without your plane?</p>
<p>Hidden in the image below are inventory items you will need to collect in order to take back the stolen documents and return to Pittsburgh. Search carefully. You will need to find the six items that will help you escape. Below are six clues to help you in your search:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Protective spectacles</li>
	<li>Flight navigators head gear</li>
	<li>Flying Insignia</li>
	<li>Oceanographers Headdress</li>
	<li>Popeys's tattoo</li>
	<li>Big wheel at Sea</li>
</ol>
	<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show invisible" role="alert"> Congrats! You have found a clue! </div>
